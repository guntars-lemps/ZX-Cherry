The ZX Cherry is a keyboard replacement for ZX Spectrum plus membrane keyboard based on Cherry MX switches. 
The keyboard keeps the original look of ZX Spectrum plus which has much better and durable keyboard. 
For extended keys the BU4066 (or compatible) switches and other elements are used. I suggest to use brown cheery switches, they are noiseless and have tactile feedback.

To use ZX Cherry keyboard together with original zx spectrum board, the ribbon cable connectors should be replaced with wired connectors and additionally two power wires must be routed together with KB0..KB4 wires to JP1 connector
