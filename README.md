The ZX Cherry is a keyboard replacement for the ZX Spectrum plus membrane keyboard based on Cherry MX switches. The keyboard keeps the original look of the ZX Spectrum plus which has a much better and more durable keyboard. For extended keys, the BU4066 (or compatible) switches and other elements are used. I suggest to use brown cherry switches, they are noiseless and have tactile feedback.

To use ZX Cherry keyboard together with the original zx spectrum board, the ribbon cable connectors should be replaced with wired connectors, and additionally two power wires must be routed together with the KB0..KB4 wires to JP1 connector
